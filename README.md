#### Note: This is a WebStorm-Project.

You have to configure your external libraries inside your WebStorm IDE as the following:

Under `Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Libraries` select `Add...` with the following options:

![WebStorm Add Library](doc/img/WebStorm_Phaser_Lib.png)

The name must be the same. We use phaser version 2.3.0

Do the same for the jQuery file. Use jQuery version 2.1.3 and name the library **jQuery** (important).
